README

The sandbox testcase is conceived for testing matching algorithms by working on 80 matching tasks.

The reference ontology can be found in:

iimb/onto.owl

Participants are required to match iimb/onto.owl against iimb/[testcasenumber]/onto.owl, with [testcasenumber] ranging from 000 to 080.

Format required for results:

Resulting alignment should be provided in the RDFAlignment format in a directory containing:

[testcasenumber]/[toolname].owl

exemple:
001/mytool.rdf
002/mytool.rdf
...
080/mytool.rdf

Details about transformations applied for each test case are provided in the file description.txt
