\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

First we give a short outline of our approach and then
  we provide a more detailed description of the individual steps.

\subsection{Outline of the approach}

We start by assuming that we are given an identity relation $\approx$.
We will then reinterpret this relation as an indiscernibility relation
  relative to different sets of predicates.
Pairs that have the same indiscernibility predicates
  are simi-discernible, i.e.: they discern resources
  based on the same criteria.
Simi-discernibility is an equivalence relation
  which partitions all pairs and thus also the identity relation $\approx$.
The members of the indiscernibility partition
  have a certain overlap with the original identity relation.
The overlap between an indiscernibility subset and the identity relation
  is called an \emph{identity subrelation}.
Each identity subrelation is characterized in terms of predicates
  from the domain vocabulary.
Different forms of identity can therefore be distinguished
  and meaningfully described.
Based on whether there is a complete or a partial overlap
  between the simi-discernible partition members and
  the identity subrelations,
  these partition members belong either to the lower ($\lowerapprox$)
  or to the higher approximation ($\higherapprox$) of $\approx$.
Besides setting a lower and a higher bound to the identity relation,
  we can also calculate the quality of the identity relation
  and the precision of each identity subrelation.

\subsection{Example}

\begin{figure*}
\label{fig:ihierarchy}

\caption{
  Example of the identity subrelations for a given dataset (IIMB).
  Each box represents such a subrelation.
  The lower and higher approximation are colored in green and red
    respectively.
  Each box shows the shared predicate terms in curly braces.
  The precision is calculated as
    the number of identity pairs in the subrelation
  divided by
    the number of pairs in the subrelation.
  The identity figure indicates the number of identity pairs in each box,
    divided by the number of identity pairs overall.
}
\end{figure*}

Our approach allows the subrelation hierarchy of a given identity relation
  to be calculated.
Figure \ref{fig:ihierarchy} shows an example of the lower and higher
  approximations for a data- and linkset combination of the IIMB database.
Each rectangular box represents an identity subrelation.
Since in this figure a partition is only drawn when there is at least one
  identity pair that is indiscernible with respect to some set of
  predicates, the higher approximation amounts to the entire figure.
The lower approximation only consists of those partition sets that contain
  at least one identity pair, and that contain no non-identity pair;
  these are distinguished by green borders.
