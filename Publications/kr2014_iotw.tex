\begin{quote}
Identity relations are at the foundation of the Linked Open Data initiative
  and on the Semantic Web in general.
They allow the interlinking of alternative descriptions of the same thing.
However, many practical uses of \verb|owl:sameAs| are known to violate its
  formal semantics.
We propose a method that assigns meaning to (the subrelations of)
  an identity relation using the predicates of the dataset schema.
Applications of this approach include automated suggestions for
  asserting/retracting identity pairs and quality assessment.
We also describe an experimental design for this approach.
