\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

Here we first give a short outline of our approach and then
  provide a more detailed description of the individual steps.

\subsection{Outline of the approach}

We assume that we are given an identity relation.
Based on this identity relation we say that
  the resources in a set $X$ are \emph{indiscernible}
  with respect to a set of properties,
  if the resources in $X$ share all and only those properties.
We call the properties that a set $X$ of resources shares
  the \emph{indiscernibility criteria} for $X$.

Then we define a new relation between pairs of resources,
  based on them sharing the same indiscernibility criteria.
This new relation induces a parition which we call
  the indiscernibility partition.
It partitions the set of resource pairs.

The members of the indiscernibility partition
  have a certain overlap with the original identity relation.
The overlap between an indiscernibility subset and the identity relation
  is called an \emph{identity subrelation}.
For each identity subrelation we can determine whether it is in
  the lower or higher approximation (or neither),
  and we can alos determine its precision.

The precision of an identity subrelation is defined as
    the number of identity pairs in the subrelation
  divided by
    the number of pairs in the subrelation.
