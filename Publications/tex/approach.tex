\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

In the following we consider an arbitrary,
  materialized RDF graph $G$ and an identity relation $\sim$ over
  the resources that occur in $G$.
The subject terms of $G$ are denoted by $S_G$, the predicate terms by $P_G$
  and the object terms by $O_G$.

For illustrative purposes we use the IIMB dataset that is used in the
  instance matching track of the 2012 Ontology Alignment Evaluation
  Initiative (OAEI) \cite{oaei_2012}.
This dataset consists of eighty ontologies $G_i$ (for $1 \leq i \leq 80$)
  that are linked to a single base ontology $G_0$.
A graph $G$ is the result of fully materializing the graph merge
  of $G_i$ (for some $1 \leq i \leq 80$) and $G_0$.
For each of these eighty linked ontologies a reference mapping is available.

In RDF a property consists of a single predicate term
  (e.g., the property ``is spoken in'' is denoted by predicate term
   \verb|IIMBTBOX:spoken_in| in the IIMB dataset).
We generalize the notion of a property to consist of
  an arbitrary number of predicate terms.
For this we define a depth-$n$ \emph{predicate path map} (abbr. ppm)
  that is characterized by a sequence of $n$ predicates
  and denotes a (functional) mapping from subject terms
  into sets of object terms
  (def. \ref{def:predicate_path},
   where $p_i \in P_G$ and $[p]_{\sim}$ is the identity set for $p$).
%$f_{\tuple{\range{p_1}{p_n}}}: S_G \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(O_G)$

\small
\begin{definition}[Predicate path map (ppm)]
\begin{align}
\label{def:predicate_path}
  f_{\tuple{\range{p_1}{p_n}}}(s)
\,=\,
  \bigsetdef{o \in O_G}{
    \exists_{\range{x_1}{x_{n-1}}} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad\\
      \bigwedge_{i=0}^{n-1}\nolimits
          \pair{I(x_i)}{I(x_{i-1})}
        \in
          \bigcup_{p \in [p_{i+1}]_{\sim}}\nolimits \mathit{Ext}(I(p))
  }\nonumber
\end{align}
\end{definition}
\normalsize

\noindent Examples of properties characterized by predicate path maps are
  ``is spoken in'' (depth-$1$) and
  ``is spoken in a country whose form of government is'' (depth-$2$).
