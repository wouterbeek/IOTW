\section{Experimental design}
\label{sec:experimental_design}

For illustrative purposes we use the IIMB dataset that is used in the
  instance matching track of the 2012 Ontology Alignment Evaluation
  Initiative (OAEI\footnote{\URL{oaei.ontologymatching.org}}).
This dataset consists of eighty ontologies $G_i$ (for $1 \leq i \leq 80$)
  that are linked to a single base ontology $G_0$.
The identity links between $G_0$ and $G_i$ are annotated with a
  confidence measure between $0.0$ and $1.0$.
A graph $G$ is the result of fully materializing the graph merge
  of $G_i$ (for some $1 \leq i \leq 80$) and $G_0$.
For each of these eighty linked ontologies a reference mapping is available.



\subsection{Experimental results}

In this experiment we incrementally remove part of the identity relation.
We then calculate the rough set representation using this altered relation.
We then evaluate how many of the removed identity pairs occur in
  the higher approximation.
Our hypothesis is that the percentage of removed identity pairs
  in the higher approximation is higher than the percentage of pairs
  in the higher approximation.
If the hypothesis is validated, this indicates that
  calculating the rough set representation for a partial identity relation
  would indeed improve suggestions for extending that identity relation.

Since the data may contain noise, using precision degrees $0.0$ and $1.0$
  may be too strict. For this experiment we have set these boundaries
  to $0.05$ and $0.95$ respectively.

In figure \ref{fig:in_higher}
  we see that the randomly removed identity pairs are often
  in the higher approximation, even when large parts of
  the identity relation are removed.

\subsection{Hypotheses}
\label{sec:hypotheses}

Since this paper focusses on our novel approach and not on evaluation,
  we will enumerate some of the hypotheses which can be evaluated
  using the here described approach:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take an {\small \texttt{owl:sameAs}} relation and
        a {\small \texttt{skos:related}}
        relation defined over the same domain.
      Merge them into a new binary relation $\sim$.
      Establishing the lower and higher approximation of $\sim$,
        the hypothesis is that pairs from {\small \texttt{owl:sameAs}}
        occur more frequently in the lower boundary than pairs from
        {\small \texttt{skos:related}},
\item Take a set of alignment pairs, each of which is associated with
        a confidence measure between $0.0$ and $1.0$.
      Choose an arbitrary cutoff point $0.0 < c < 1.0$.
      The hypothesis is that alignments with a confidence larger than $c$
        occur more frequently in the lower approximation than alignments
        with a confidence smaller than $c$.
\item Take a set of automatically generated alignment pairs with
        associated confidence measures and take the gold standard or
        reference alignment for the same dataset.
      The hypothesis is that pairs that occur in the lower approximation
        of the alignment appear relatively more often in the gold standard
        than pairs that occur in the higher approximation of the alignment.
\item The quality measure $\alpha$ of a reference alignment is generally
        higher than the accuracy measure of an automatically generated
        alignment for the same dataset.
      Or, the quality measure is generally higher for identity relations
        that domain experts consider to be correct.
\end{enumerate}

Also, the IIMB datasets are quite small (tens of thousands of triples).
We will have the verify whether the current implementation is able to scale
  to bigger datasets.
