\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

The implementation built for this paper is deployed as an extension pack
  of the ClioPatria triple store \cite{schreiber_2006}.
For RDF graphs that are loaded in ClioPatria this extension calculates
  the discernibility partition, rough set approximation and accuracy.
The results are visualized using GraphViz and are displayed in a
  Web interface using SVG.
Interactive Ajax code allows the user to click on nodes in the SVG graphic
  to navigate to descriptions of the resource pairs that occur in
  that partition set while not being in the identity relation.
This implementation may facilitate the validation of hypotheses in this
  new experimental setup.

Existing SW libraries implement equivalence relations for common datatypes.
Equivalence is not always in line with identity though.
We have made exceptions for specific values that are known to have
  equivalent non-identities (such as $0$ and $-0$)
  non-equivalent identities (such as $NaN$ for \texttt{float}).\cite{XSD11}
The latter even provides a rare instance of the violation of
  definition \ref{def:identity}.
