# TODO

IOTW:
  * IOTW should have all references to a current assoc removed.
    Use pass-by-reference instead?
  * Further document, modularize, and clean the IOTW code.

PGC:
  * ASSOC_MULTI should use pass-by-reference for each of its functions?
  * XFN needs its export rewritten to use GV_DCG and GV_FILE.
